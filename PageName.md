# Introduction #

Most of the code in these directories is runnable by simply typing:

make clean;make



# Details #

There are two main directories here: the megaPythonAVR and megaPythonDesktop.
This is done because for development of new features, it's very useful to
get them working in the Desktop version first.  For standard microcontroller
development, e.g. with the Atemga644, stick with megaPythonAVR.

  * Does **that** sound _good_ ?
  * I hope so...
  * for now!
